/* 

Given two Linked Lists, create union and intersection lists that contain union and intersection of the elements present in the given lists. Order of elments in output lists doesn’t matter.

Example:

Input:
   List1: 10->15->4->20
   lsit2:  8->4->2->10
Output:
   Intersection List: 4->10
   Union List: 2->8->20->4->15->10
